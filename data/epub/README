ABOUT

tei2epub is a set of tools to convert TEI XML content into OPS/OPF
format ebooks.  

It should be trivial to adapt to other XML formats by replacing the
TEI XSLT with other stylesheets, and modifying the create_html()
method to chunk the output appropriately.


See http://www.idpf.org/ for more information about the epub format.



PREREQUISITES

tei2epub requires one non-standard Python module:

  * lxml (http://codespeak.net/lxml/)

However, feel free to replace it with your favorite Python XML
library.

It also requires the TEI XSLT which is not included:

  * http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/get.xml

and an implementation of ZIP ('zip' by default). 

To configure for your environment, modify:

  bin/settings.py

If you wish to use the project as-is, you should only need to change
TEI2XHTML_XSLT to point at the directory where you have installed the
TEI package.  The other pathnames are relative to the project directory.



USAGE

  bin/convert.py path-to-source-xml [alternate output name]

Without the second argument, tei2epub will strip any path and file
extension from our source XML and create a working directory in build/
and output directory in dist/ with the base name.  Otherwise you can
override that base name with the second argument.


TESTING

The distribution includes a version of epubcheck, which is officially distributed
at http://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/

epubcheck is a Java application that can be run from the command line as:

  java -jar epubcheck.jar epub-bundle

You will need to unzip the distribution and have a Java runtime to use it.
