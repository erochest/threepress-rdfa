<p id="bw-about-description">
  The ePub standard is language-neutral and Bookworm is too.  
  Bookworm search supports advanced full-text features in 
  multiple languages.</p>

<h3>Stemming</h3>
<p>
  Bookworm's full-text search feature supports an advanced feature known
  as <em>stemming</em>.  Most European languages indicate part-of-speech by modifying
  words with prefixes or (more commonly) suffixes.  <strong>Stemming is the process of
  reducing all possible parts of speech for a word to a single root, or <em>stem</em>.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  In English, for example, 'run' is the most basic or <em>stem</em> form of the 
  verb <em>to run</em>.   To pluralize it, we append an &ndash;s and get 'runs'.
  When using the word as a verb in the present continuous, we add &ndash;ing to get 
  'running'.  Note that 'runs' can be a noun ("I went out for two runs this week") or a 
  verb in the present tense ("He runs.")  From the point of view of a search engine,
  grammar doesn't matter, just spelling. 
</p>
<p>
  A <em>stemmer</em> is software which turns any form of a word &mdash; "run", "runs", "running" &mdash;
  into a stem.  That means that if you search for one form of the word, all of them
  will be found.  This usually provides a more satisfying search experience.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Changing your search language will not affect which ePubs are searched.</strong>
  Not all ePubs correctly indicate what language they're in, so your search will
  always be across all of your books, not just the ones in the language you specified.
  Instead, the language setting determines which stemming rules will apply to your
  word.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if I set my stemmer to be English and search for 'spaghetti',
  Bookworm will also search for 'spaghettis', 'spaghetting', 'spaghettied', etc.
  (Stemmers don't know whether a given stem makes sense; they operate just on the
  spelling.)  However, if I change my language setting to Italian, then 'spaghetti'
  will stem to 'spaghett' (because &ndash;i is a plural marker in Italian, the 
  way &ndash;s is in English).  A search for 'spaghetti' will find ePubs
  containing 'spaghetti' whether the ePub is in English or Italian, because the
  search term itself is always considered.
</p>
<p>
  If you primarily read ePubs in languages other than English, you will likely
  benefit from <a href="{% url profile_language %}">changing your default language</a>. 
</p>
<h3>Disabling stemming</h3>
<p>
  If you want to search for a word and have it <em>not</em> stem, enclose it in
  quotation marks.  Quotation marks can also be used to perform phrase searches.
</p>

<h3>Languages with stemmers</h3>
<p>
  Bookworm uses the <a href="http://xapian.org">Xapian</a> search engine, which in turn uses the 
  <a href="http://xapian.org/docs/stemming.html">Snowball Stemming Algorithms</a>.
  All of the stemmers in Xapian are available for use in Bookworm:
  <ul>
  {% for lang in LANGUAGES %}
    <li> {{ lang.1 }} </li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</p>
<p>The default language is English.</p>
