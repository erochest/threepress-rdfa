Prerequisites
=============

Via easy_install:

- cssutils
- python-openid (2.x)
- python-yadis

Database
--------

The first time you get here, manually setup MySQL database 
and user permissions according to values in ./local.py

Then, from the project root:

./manage.py syncdb
./manage.py test library # Sanity check

You should only need to run syncdb initially, or when the schema changes.

===

To test the models and views:
./manage.py test library 

===

To run a local development server:
./manage.py runserver 

(./run.sh is a short-hand, and will put the dev server in the background)

===

To start over with a clean database:
./clear-db.sh
