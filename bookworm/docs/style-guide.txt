Bookworm Style Guide
--------------------

The primary Django application which runs Bookworm is `library`.  This
app contains all of the site UI and most of its features.

This document assumes some basic knowledge of Django templates, HTML
and CSS.  Django template reference: 
Important directories and files::

  library/
          templates/
                    static/
                           base.css
                           mobile.css
                           about.css
                    base.html
                    shell.html
                    mobile/
                           base.html


Templates
---------

shell.html
==========
This is the outermost framing template, containing the main <head> and
<body> (including the top header) for almost every page on the site.
Modify any site-wide structure here.

This is not used in the mobile version; see
`library/templates/mobile/base.html` for that template.

base.html
==========
This contains the template for the body area, including the
left-nav and main content area.  It is not used by any pages that do
not include a left nav, such as the "Take a Tour" page, which uses
`shell.html` directly.

mobile/base.html
================
The top-level template for the mobile version of the site.  It is used
with `mobile.css` to override styles from the main site.

Stylesheets
-----------

base.css
========
Most of the sites in the site are here.  One item to note is that many
styles are marked `!important`; this is to prevent them from being
overridden by imported book styles.

The majority of styles are prefixed with `bw-` to avoid conflicting
with imported book styles.  This convention should be maintained.

Styles are extensively documented with in-line comments.

mobile.css
==========
These styles apply only to the mobile web version of the site.

auth.css
========
These are used primarily on login pages.

document.css
============
Used only from `view.html` when displaying a book.

simple.css
==========
Invoked when Reading Mode is in effect. Overrides many other styles to
generate the Reading Mode user interface.
