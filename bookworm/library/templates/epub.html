    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      ePub is an open format of the The International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF).
      It is based on XML and XHTML, re-using existing standards for 
      digital books.

    <h2>{% trans "XHTML support" %}</h2>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Because the most common content format for ePub is XHTML, ePub and the web browser
      are a natural fit.  
      This allows Bookworm to support advanced layout and markup
      that standalone reading software often does not, including:
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>{% trans "Tables <!-- trans: HTML tables --> " %}</li>
      <li>{% trans "Lists <!-- trans: HTML lists -->" %}</li>
      <li>{% trans "Fixed-width fonts" %}</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      These features are especially important in non-fiction works
      such as technical titles or scientific papers.

    <a name="css"></a>
    <h2>{% trans "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript" %}</h2>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Bookworm will render any CSS stylesheets that are packaged with an ebook.  In order to prevent 
      interference with Bookworm's native CSS, an ePub's included stylesheets are slightly modified
      to restrict their effects to the book's content area. 
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Any external JavaScript files that might be bundled with the ePub are <em>not</em> loaded,
      and any &lt;script&gt; tags embedded in the content are removed.  This is a security feature
      to prevent malicious scripts from being uploaded to the site.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Bookworm includes its own stylesheets specially-formatted for the printed page.
      Try using your browser's "Print Preview" feature while reading an ePub
      to see how it would appear when printed.

      The table of contents metadata contain chunks at levels other than 
      the chapter. It might
      also include chunks at the "part" or sub-chapter level, 
      organized into a nested hierarchy.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Bookworm will expand nested items in the Table of Contents

      When multiple sub-sections exist, a small arrow will appear next

    <h2>{% trans "Reading system conformance" %}</h2>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      In accordance with the ePub specification, Bookworm will &lsquo;open&rsquo;
      the ePub to the first item in the NCX file with the attribute
      <code>linear</code> set to &lsquo;yes&rsquo;  Counterintuitively,
      this may mean that in some titles
      the default page for the ePub will not be the first item in the
      NCX file.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Bookworm is not yet a truly conforming reading system;
      see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/threepress/issues/list">issues</a>
      page for the status on several bugs related to ePub conformance
      issues.

    <img src="/static/svg.png" alt="SVG logo" align="right"/>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      As a browser-based application, 
      Bookworm supports illustrations and photos in all the 
      formats that ePub does: <em>JPEG</em>, <em>GIF</em>
      and <em>PNG</em>.  Scalable Vector Graphics (<em>SVG</em>) if
      images are handled by linking to an external SVG file,
      as many browsers do not have inline-SVG support via the
      <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.
      {% endblocktrans %}

    <a name="dtbook"></a>
      <h2>DTBook</h2>
      <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      The OPS specification indicates that valid ePubs may 
      contain content in either XHTML or <a href="http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/DTBook">DTBook</a>.
      {% endblocktrans %}      
      </p>
      <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Bookworm supports DTBook-formatted ePubs by automatically converting
      their content to XHTML.  This is done using XSLT derived from the <a href="http://daisymfc.sourceforge.net/">DAISY pipeline</a>.
      {% endblocktrans %}
      </p>
      <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        You can always get back to the original DTBook content by downloading the ePub from any book page.

    <a name="fonts"></a>      
    <h2>{% trans "Fonts" %}</h2>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Bookworm will support any font declarations made using CSS 1 or CSS 2.
      In theory it could support embedded fonts as defined by CSS 3 if the browser
      does, but this has not been tested (samples welcome!).
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <a name="invalid"></a>
    <h2>{% trans "How Bookworm treats invalid ePub" %}</h2>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      One of the design goals of Bookworm is that it should
      render ePub documents which do not completely follow
      the specification.  However, there are many cases in which
      it will not be able to correctly parse all the parts
      of the file and will reject it.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Any ePub book which is found to be seriously malformed
      will be automatically handed off to the 
      <a href="http://www.threepress.org/document/epub-validate/">threepress.org epubcheck service</a>.
      The results from <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/">epubcheck</a> are reported to the user who is uploading
      the book.
      It is hoped that the messages from Bookworm and epubcheck 
      will clearly identify the problem with the ePub file.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <a name="limitations"></a>
    <h2>{% trans "Limitations" %}</h2>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Obviously, Bookworm is limited by the features available in 
      the user's browser.  It is recommended
      to be used with recent versions of Firefox, Safari or Chrome,
      however Internet Explorer 6 and 7 are also supported.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Some extremely long-form ebooks, such as single 'page' comics
      or unbroken novel-length texts, are not appropriate for web-based reading.
      Document authors are advised to break up long texts into
      individual XHTML files if at all appropriate.  
      This is especially important
      when creating ePub documents for mobile devices, which often
      have problems with large file sizes. (The Sony Reader cannot read XHTML files
      larger than 300Kb in size, for example.)
      {% endblocktrans %}

    <h2>{% trans "Other open-source ePub" %}</h2>
