  <h2>How does it work?  What do I download?</h2>
  <p>
    The great thing about Bookworm is there's nothing to download!  Here's how it works:
  </p>
  <div id="bw-howto" class="bw-info-box">
    <ol id="bw-howto-list">
      <li> <a href="{% url user_signup %}">Create a Bookworm account and log in</a> </li>
      <li> <a href="{% url upload %}">Upload an ePub book</a></li>
      <li> Start reading by just clicking on the book title in your library!</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p>
    Because your books are stored on the Bookworm site, you can read them from any web browser
    and on most mobile web devices, anywhere in the world!  We're working on ways to read your
    book content on your mobile phone even when you aren't connected to the internet.

  <a name="whats_epub"></a>
  <h2>What's ePub?</h2>
  <p>
    ePub is the open ebook standard developed by the <a
    href="http://www.idpf.org/">International Digital Publishing
    Forum</a> (<acronym>IDPF</acronym>).  It is based on a number of
    other open standards including XHTML, making it ideally suited to
    be read on web browsers. 
  </p>
  <p>
    ePub books can be read on your home computer (using Bookworm, Adobe Digital Editions or Stanza), 
    on your iPhone (using Bookworm or Stanza) and on the Sony Reader PRS-505.
  </p>

  <a name="mobile"></a>
  <h2>Can I use Bookworm on my mobile device?</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="{% url tour %}#step3"><img src="/static/images/screenshots/iphone.jpg" alt="Bookworm on the iPhone" class="bw-screenshot-page" align="right" style="margin-bottom:10px" width="100"/></a>
    Absolutely!  A special version of the site optimized for mobile devices (especially 
    the iPhone) is available at <a href="http://mobile.threepress.org/">http://mobile.threepress.org/</a>.
    It has also been tested on the Blackberry, Opera Mobile and the Kindle's Whispernet service.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to reading material directly on Bookworm, iPhone users can export their
    Bookworm books to <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/">Stanza</a>.   For more
    information, see the <a href="{% url tour %}#step4">tour</a>.
  </p>
  <a name="where_epubs"></a>
  <h2>Where can I get ePubs?</h2>
  <p>
    As of December, 2008, many publishers are getting on board with
    ePub. Penguin, Harper-Collins and Random House have all released titles in the format.
    An updated list of ePub bookstores can be found at <a href="http://www.epubbooks.com/">epubbooks.com</a>.
  </p>
    <a name="cant_read"></a>
  <h2>I'm not able to read this ePub book I uploaded</h2>
  <p>
    There may be a problem with the e-book (many publishers are still
    learning how to create them), or there may be a bug in Bookworm.
    If you encounter an error while uploading or reading a book, the
    Bookworm developers are automatically notified and will fix the
    problem if possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    It may also be that you've uploaded a book that includes Digital
    Rights Management (DRM).  Bookworm does not support DRM'ed books.
    Check the website where you purchased the book for information on
    how to read it (and complain to the publisher that you can't read
    your books where you'd like!)
  </p>

    tips on troubleshooting Bookworm.</p>

  <h2>I'm a publisher and I have questions or feature requests</h2>
  <p>
    Threepress is a publisher-serving corporation with many years of experience in building
    products in the industry.  We would be happy to discuss the ePub format, getting your books
    into ePub and even extending Bookworm with custom features for your publications.  Please
    contact <a href="mailto:bookworm@threepress.org">bookworm@threepress.org</a>
    and we'll get back to you right away.
  </p>
  <a name="other_formats"></a>
  <h2>Will other book formats be supported, such as PDF or mobi? What about DRM ebooks?</h2>
  <p>
    Bookworm is meant to push adoption of the open ePub format and there are no plans to 
    support closed formats like mobi or those with limited flexibility like PDF.  
  </p>
  <p>
    DRM (digital rights management) has been shown to be detrimental to technology adoption,
    does not significantly prevent piracy, and provides a terrible user experience.
    Bookworm will never support DRM'ed ebooks that require special software to unlock.
    Instead we encourage publishers to explore forms of "soft" DRM (such as watermarking digital books with the name of the purchaser).
  </p>
  <a name="sharing"></a>
  <h2>Is it possible to share my books with other Bookworm users, or link to one of my books?</h2>

  <p>There is limited support for sharing on Bookworm.  Books that are in the public domain,
  books uploaded by their own authors, or publishers who authorize books to be public
  can all make Bookworm books accessible to the larger internet.  
  </p>
  <p>Public books are in a very early beta stage.  To request that a book be made public,
  please contact <a href="mailto:bookworm@threepress.org">bookworm@threepress.org</a> for more information.
  </p>
  <a name="backup"></a>
  <h2>Are my books securely stored and backed up?</h2>
  <p>
    Although books are backed up, Bookworm is not a commercial product
    and has limited financial and legal resources.
    No guarantees are provided for the security of your books or the reliability of the service.
    Store copies of all your books on your own computers.
