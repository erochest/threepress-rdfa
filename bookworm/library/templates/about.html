  <h1>About Bookworm</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Bookworm</strong> is an experimental platform for storing and reading epub-format books online.
  </p>

  <h2>What's epub?</h2>
  <p>
    Epub is the open e-book standard developed by the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/">International Digital Publishing Forum</a> (<acronym>IDPF</acronym>).  It is based on a number of other open standards including XHTML, making it ideally suited to be read on web browsers.
  </p>

  <h2>Where can I get epub-formatted books?</h2>
  <p>
    At this time, contemporary, popular books are not widely available in epub, as neither the Amazon Kindle nor Sony Reader support the format.  <a href="http://feedbooks.com/">Feedbooks</a> is a excellent site for downloading public domain and contributed books in epub as well as other digital book formats.  <a href="http://www.threepress.org/">Threepress</a> also offers several epub formatted books which have been auto-converted from the TEI XML standard.</p>

  <h2>What Bookworm isn't</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> <em>A general ebook platform</em>. There are many good standalone ebook readers for computers, including <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/">Adobe Digital Editions</a>, <a href="http://www.fbreader.org/">FBReader</a> and <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/">Stanza</a>. Bookworm is meant specifically to test the viability of using ordinary web browsers as epub rendering engines, not to host PDF, Mobi, or other formats.</li>
    <li> <em>An ebook sharing site</em>.  There are currently no plans to support sharing of books on Bookworm.  I feel it would be detrimental to the adoption of DRM-free e-books to encourage digital distribution at this critical time.  Google App Engine's infrastructure would certainly faciliate this feature, and so it may be considered in the future.
    </li>
    <li> <em>Mature software</em>.  Your books may be deleted or altered at any time as features are added or modified.  Please store your books locally.
    </li>
  </ol>
