    {% blocktrans %}ePub is the open ebook standard developed by the <a

    Forum</a> (<acronym>IDPF</acronym>).  It is based on a number of
    other open standards including XHTML, making ePub books ideally suited to
    be read on web browsers. {% endblocktrans %}

    Absolutely!  A special version of the site optimized for mobile devices (especially

    Bookworm has also been tested on the Blackberry, Opera Mobile, Skyfire and the Kindle's Whispernet service.{% endblocktrans %}

  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}As of March 2009, many publishers are getting on board with
    ePub. O'Reilly, Penguin, Harper-Collins and Random House have all released titles in the format.
    An updated list of ePub bookstores can be found at <a href="http://www.epubbooks.com/">epubbooks.com</a>.{% endblocktrans %}

    <a name="cant_read"></a>
  <h2>{{ _("I'm not able to read this ePub book I uploaded")}}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}There may be a problem with the e-book (many publishers are still
    learning how to create them), or there may be a bug in Bookworm.
    If you encounter an error while uploading or reading a book, the
    Bookworm developers are automatically notified and will fix the
    problem if possible.{% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}It may also be that you've uploaded a book that includes Digital
    Rights Management (DRM).  Bookworm does not support DRM'ed books.

  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}Threepress is a publisher-serving corporation with many years of experience in building
    products in the industry.  We would be happy to discuss the ePub format, getting your books
    into ePub and even extending Bookworm with custom features for your publications.  Please

  <a name="other_formats"></a>
  <h2>{{ _("Will other book formats be supported, such as PDF or mobi? What about DRM ebooks?") }}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}Bookworm is meant to push adoption of the open ePub format and there are no plans to 
    support closed formats like mobi or those with limited flexibility like PDF.  {% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}DRM (digital rights management) has been shown to be detrimental to technology adoption,
    does not significantly prevent piracy, and provides a terrible user experience.
    Bookworm will never support DRM'ed ebooks that require special software to unlock.
    Instead we encourage publishers to explore forms of "soft" DRM (such as watermarking digital books with the name of the purchaser).{% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
  <a name="sharing"></a>
  <h2>
    {% blocktrans %}Is it possible to share my books with other Bookworm users, or link to one of my books?{% endblocktrans %}
  </h2>

  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}There is limited support for sharing on Bookworm.  Books that are in the public domain,
    books uploaded by their own authors, or publishers who authorize books to be public
    can all make Bookworm books accessible to the larger internet.{% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}Public books are in a very early beta stage.  To request that a book be made public, please contact <a href="mailto:{{ ADMIN_EMAIL }}">{{ ADMIN_EMAIL }}</a> for more information.{% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
  <a name="backup"></a>
  <h2> {% blocktrans %} Are my books securely stored and backed up?{% endblocktrans %}
</h2>
  <p>
{% blocktrans %}
    Although books are backed up, Bookworm is not a commercial product
    and has limited financial and legal resources.
    No guarantees are provided for the security of your books or the reliability of the service.
    Store copies of all your books on your own computers.
