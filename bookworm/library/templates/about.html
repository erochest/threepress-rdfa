  <h1>About Bookworm</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Bookworm</strong> is an experimental platform for storing and reading ePub-format books online.
  </p>

  <h2>What's ePub?</h2>
  <p>
    ePub is the open e-book standard developed by the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/">International Digital Publishing Forum</a> (<acronym>IDPF</acronym>).  It is based on a number of other open standards including XHTML, making it ideally suited to be read on web browsers.
  </p>

  <h2>Where can I get ePub-formatted books?</h2>
  <p>
    At this time, contemporary, popular books are not widely available in ePub, as neither the Amazon Kindle nor Sony Reader support the format.  <a href="http://feedbooks.com/">Feedbooks</a> is a excellent site for downloading public domain and contributed books in ePub as well as other digital book formats.  <a href="http://www.threepress.org/">Threepress</a> also offers several ePub books which have been auto-converted from the TEI XML standard.</p>

  <h2>What Bookworm isn't</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> <em>A general ebook platform</em>. There are many good standalone ebook readers for computers, including <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/">Adobe Digital Editions</a>, <a href="http://www.fbreader.org/">FBReader</a> and <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/">Stanza</a>. Bookworm is meant specifically to test the viability of using ordinary web browsers as ePub rendering engines, not to host PDF, Mobi, or other formats.</li>
    <li> <em>An ebook sharing site</em>.  There are currently no plans to support sharing of books on Bookworm.  I feel it would be detrimental to the adoption of DRM-free e-books to encourage digital distribution at this critical time.  Google App Engine's infrastructure would certainly faciliate this feature, and so it may be considered in the future.
    </li>
    <li> <em>Mature software</em>.  Your books may be deleted or altered at any time as features are added or modified.  Please store your books locally.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Who is responsible for Bookworm?</h2>
  <p>
    Bookworm software is free and available for download under the terms of the BSD license from the <a href="http://www.threepress.org/download/">download page</a>. It is a product of <a href="http://www.threepress.org/">threepress</a>, a venue for experimenting with open source publishing software, and is written by <a href="http://www.threepress.org/about/liza/">Liza Daly</a> with contributions from <a href="http://kfahlgren.com/blog">Keith Fahlgren</a>.  Any problems with Bookworm can be reported to <a href="mailto:bookworm@threepress.org">bookworm@threepress.org</a>. (Feature requests welcome too!)
  </p>

  <h2>Why do I receive a "Connection Closed" error when uploading a book?</h2>
  <p>
    Bookworm is build on <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a>, a new platform for hosting
    web applications that are built to scale to millions of users.  App Engine is still in an early beta release and Google
    has placed some restrictions on the number and size of files added to it.  Unfortunately this means that books
    greater than <strong>1 megabyte</strong> in size cannot be added to your library.  
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have the ability to author ePub files, try removing any large media such as images before uploading.  Even very 
    long e-books will be quite small in byte size if they are compressed at the maximum level and do not have
    many attached media files.
