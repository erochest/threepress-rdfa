  <h1>About Bookworm</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Bookworm</strong> is an experimental platform for storing and reading ePub-format books online.
  </p>

  <h2>How does it work?  What do I download?</h2>
  <p>
    The great thing about Bookworm is there's nothing to download!  Here's how it works:
  </p>
  <div id="bw-howto">
    <ol id="bw-howto-list">
      <li> <a href="{% url user_signup %}">Create a Bookworm account and log in</a> </li>
      <li> <a href="{% url upload %}">Upload an ePub book</a></li>
      <li> Start reading by just clicking on the book title in your library!</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <p>
    Because your books are stored on the Bookworm site, you can read them from any web browser
    and on most mobile web devices, anywhere in the world!  We're working on ways to read your
    book content on your mobile phone even when you aren't connected to the internet.
  </p>

  <h2>What's ePub?</h2>
  <p>
    ePub is the open ebook standard developed by the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/">International Digital Publishing Forum</a> (<acronym>IDPF</acronym>).  It is based on a number of other open standards including XHTML, making it ideally suited to be read on web browsers.
  </p>

  <h2>Can I use Bookworm on my mobile device?</h2>
  <p>
    Absolutely!  A special version of the site optimized for mobile devices (especially 
    the iPhone) is available at <a href="http://mobile.threepress.org/">http://mobile.threepress.org/</a>.
    It has also been tested on the Blackberry, Opera Mobile and the Kindle's Whispernet service.
  </p>
  <h2>Where can I get ePub-formatted books?</h2>
  <p>
    At this time, contemporary, popular books are not widely available in ePub, as the Amazon Kindle does not currently support it. Some sources include: 
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/ebooks/">O'Reilly is offering a number of books in ePub format.</a></li>
      <li> <a href="http://feedbooks.com/">Feedbooks</a> is a excellent site for downloading public domain and contributed books in ePub as well as other digital book formats.</li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.threepress.org/">Threepress</a> also offers several ePub books which have been auto-converted from the TEI XML standard.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>I'm a publisher and I have questions or feature requests</h2>
  <p>
    Threepress is a publisher-serving corporation with many years of experience in building
    products in the industry.  We would be happy to discuss the ePub format, getting your books
    into ePub and even extending Bookworm with custom features for your publications.  Please
    contact <a href="mailto:bookworm@threepress.org">bookworm@threepress.org</a>
    and we'll get back to you right away.
  </p>

  <h2>Will other book formats be supported, such as PDF or mobi? What about DRM ebooks?</h2>
  <p>
    Bookworm is meant to push adoption of the open ePub format and there are no plans to 
    support closed formats like mobi or those with limited flexibility like PDF.  
  </p>
  <p>
    DRM (digital rights management) has been shown to be detrimental to technology adoption,
    does not significantly prevent piracy, and provides a terrible user experience.
    Bookworm will never support DRM'ed ebooks that require special software to unlock.
    Instead we encourage publishers to explore forms of "soft" DRM (such as watermarking digital books with the name of the purchaser).
  </p>
  <h2>Is it possible to share my books with other Bookworm users, or link to one of my books?</h2>
  <p>There are currently no plans to support sharing of books on Bookworm.  We feel it would be detrimental to the adoption of DRM-free ebooks to encourage digital distribution at this critical time.  However, individual publishers may choose to opt-in for sharing notes, books or other special features.  Please contact <a href="mailto:bookworm@threepress.org">bookworm@threepress.org</a> for more information.    
  </p>

  <h2>Are my books securely stored and backed up?</h2>
  <p>
    No.  Bookworm is not a commercial product and has limited financial and legal resources.
    No guarantees are provided for the security of your books or the reliability of the service.
    Please do not upload sensitive material (e.g. pre-print books, or internal corporate documents).
    Store copies of all your books on your own computers.
  </p>
