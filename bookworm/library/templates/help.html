  <h2>{% trans "I'm having problems adding a book" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% trans "Here are some common things to check" %}:
  </p>
  <h3>{% trans "Is the book in ‘ePub’ format?" %}</h3>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    Bookworm only accepts ePub books.  You'll know an ebook is in ePub format
    if its name ends in <strong>.epub</strong>.  If it doesn't, it's probably 
    a PDF or some other kind of ebook.  Check the website where you got the book
    for help on what software to use when reading it.
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
  <h3>{% trans "Did Bookworm tell you there was a problem with the book?" %}</h3>
  <p>
    {% trans "You might get an error message like this when you add a book" %}:
  </p>
  <div align="center"><a href="/static/images/screenshots/upload-error.png"><img src="/static/images/screenshots/upload-error.png" align="center" class="bw-screenshot-page" width="400"/></a>
  <br />  <br />
  (<a href="/static/images/screenshots/upload-error.png">    {% blocktrans %}click to enlarge {% endblocktrans %}</a>)
  </div>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    The ePub format is still  new, and not all ePub books are made 
    quite right.  Bookworm tries to accept a wide variety of ePubs, but
    sometimes it can't handle ebooks that are too unusual.
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
 
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    On the other hand, Bookworm is also new and still has bugs.  When your
    book was uploaded into Bookworm and a problem was detected, Bookworm contacted
    an <a href="http://www.threepress.org/document/epub-validate/">ePub validation system</a>,
    which uses a program called ‘epubcheck’ by Adobe.  
    Bookworm will tell you if epubcheck also thought there was a problem with the ebook.
    If they both agree, it's likely that the publisher didn't make the ePub correctly.
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    Whenever an ePub book fails to get added to the library, the Bookworm
    developer is notified.  If a bug in Bookworm is found, it's usually fixed in a few days,
    so check back or email <a href="mailto:{{ ADMIN_EMAIL }}">{{ ADMIN_EMAIL }}</a>
    for a status.
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
  <h3>{% trans "Does the book contain DRM (Digital Rights Management)?" %}</h3>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    Some ePub books have restrictions that prevent them from being read on 
    unauthorized devices.  Bookworm does not support any kind of DRM and
    the developers feel it is not a sufficient piracy deterrent to warrent
    limiting where you can read.
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    Consult the bookstore where you purchased the book or the publisher about
    which software you should use to read your book.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>
  <h3>{% trans "Is the ebook very large, or contain large images?" %}</h3>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    Some ebooks are too large to be safely stored and viewed in Bookworm.
    Excessively-large books will be rejected.  An ePub is consider too large if it is 
    over 30 megabytes in size.
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
  <a name="devices"></a>
  <h2>{% trans "Can I use Bookworm with my e-reader?" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    Yes, if your e-reader can open ePub books.  In each case you will need to
    download your ebook to your computer and then add it to one of these
    applications, or use the mobile version of Bookworm with a device
    that is online.
