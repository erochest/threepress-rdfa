    Bookworm isn't just for readers.  Publishers can use it to test their ePub files
    before distributing them, and to experiment with advanced features such as
    stylesheets and SVG.

    <strong>Verify that your ePub is valid</strong>. Many tools creating ePubs
    do not create them with all of the required attributes and files.
    Some ePub readers are very loose in what they accept, so checking your
    ePub in Adobe Digital Editions is not sufficient to be certain that your
    ebook will be readable everywhere.

    While developers can download and install their own copy of Adobe's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/">epubcheck</a>
    tool, it may be easier to use Threepress's web-based <a href="http://www.threepress.org/document/epub-validate/">ePub validator</a>.
    It uses epubcheck but wraps it in a convenient web form upload.
    {% endblocktrans %}

    {% blocktrans %}
    Although Bookworm will accept many kinds of ePubs which are not strictly
    valid, it is always best to test them first.  Valid ePubs are much more likely
    to work consistently with new ereaders that are developed in the future.

    Once your book has been added, click around and make sure it looks
    right. Here are some additional testing tips:

  <h2>{% trans "Testing checklist" %}</h2>
  <ol>

    <strong>Is the metadata correct?</strong> You can view a book's
    metadata on the <strong>Book information</strong> page available
    from the table of contents of any book. 
    {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li> 
      {% blocktrans %}
      <strong>Is the copyright information in the metadata present and 
      accurate?</strong>  Readers need to know if the book has full copyright
      protection, is public domain, or is released with limited rights reserved
      via Creative Commons.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li> 
      {% blocktrans %}
      <strong>Is the table of contents correct and in the right order?</strong>
      Bookworm uses the <code>playOrder</code> attribute of the NCX file
      and the ordering of the items in the TOC.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li> 
      {% blocktrans %}
      <strong>Are all images appearing?</strong> 
      Bookworm can accommodate a wide
      variety of link forms, from images linked directly from the TOC to
      those found in anchor tags within content. The images <em>must</em> be 
      listed in the OPF file to appear in Bookworm, as directed by the ePub specification.
      {% endblocktrans %}

    </li>
    <li> 
      {% blocktrans %}
      <strong>Are all special or foreign characters displaying correctly?</strong>
      ePub books complying with the specification must be encoded with
      either UTF-8 or UTF-16, but Bookworm supports only UTF-8.  (Bidirectional text is supported
      but you will need to include that directive in the CSS.)
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
  </ol>
  </div>
  <a name="secure"></a>
  <h2>{% trans "Are ePub files on Bookworm secure?" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    Although Bookworm is designed to prevent file sharing and
    accidental release of books into the "wild," we accept no
    liability for software failure which may result in an ebook 
    becoming publicly viewable. 
    {% endblocktrans %}

    However, Threepress can arrange for a private version of Bookworm
    to be set up for large-scale testing or especially-sensitive
    material. Contact <a

    for more details.
